# SIMPLE-NOTE-TAKER
I developed a note-taker application utilizing Hibernate for the back-end, along with JSP and Servlets for handling server-side operations. The front-end was built using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly interface. The application allows users to create, update, and delete notes.
